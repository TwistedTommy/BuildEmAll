### The Original Automated ROM Patcher
## About
BuildEmAll or BEA is the original software application for automating the process of building ROMs from patches and building patches from ROMs.  
  
Are you a ROM collector who wants to save vast amounts of time and bandwidth? Are you a patcher who is tired of working like an octopussy? If so, BuildEmAll is for you. It's easy and fun to use.  
  
BuildEmAll comes with both a command line interface and a graphical interface. No matter which interface you choose, building ROMs and patches is easy. Just run BuildEmAll to build all of the ROMs or patches.  
  
BuildEmAll uses Xdelta to create a patch containing the diff data between two ROMs. The resulting patch is usually very small and can be used to recreate an exact image of a second ROM.  
  
Although BuildEmAll has more than one purpose, it's main purpose is to automate the process of building ROMs and patches. This automated process not only saves you vast amounts of time and bandwidth, but also creates a uniform set of patches.  
  
BuildEmAll makes life simpler and easier. Just run BuildEmAll and go eat dinner, go to work or go to sleep. When you return, BuildEmAll has built every possible ROM or patch that it can... Or at least it's still working on it.  
  
Using BuildEmAll, the sky is the limit as to how many patches and datafiles you create.
